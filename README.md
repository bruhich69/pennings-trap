# pennings-trap
Models trajectory of 1, 2 and 3 particles in Pennings trap and finds frequencies using rfft.

zadacha_koshi_1.py uses function from diffur_methods.py (can be found in my profile).

Number in the name of file is quantity of particles in task.

76Ge - +27|e| - particle.

In zadacha_koshi_1.py frequencies are close to theoretical ones.
